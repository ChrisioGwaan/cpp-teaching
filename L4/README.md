* An enumeration is a user-defined data type that consists of integral constants.
* It is also used in Python. The idea for enumeration is the same. For example, when you are iterating a list {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}. If you use enumerate to iterate the list, in `Python`, it would be like `for i, key in enumerate(list)`. `i` is the position and `key` is the value. Therefore, C++ has the same idea for it, check the code below.

```
enum week {
    Sunday,     // 0
    Monday,     // 1
    Tuesday,    // 2
    Wednesday,  // 3
    Thursday,   // 4
    Friday,     // 5
    Saturday    // 6
};
...
    
week today;
today = Wednesday; // 3
cout << "Day " << today+1; // Day 4
...
```
