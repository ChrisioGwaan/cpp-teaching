Q1: Given a sorted list of integers, output the middle integer. 
    A negative number indicates the end of the input (the negative number is not a part of the sorted list). 

Constrains:
1) The maximum number of inputs for any test case should not exceed 9. If exceeded, output "Too many numbers".
2) Assume the number of integers is always odd.
3) No need to write a sorting array function, we assume that the inputs are in ascending order.

Hint: 
1) First read the data into an array. 
2) Then, based on the array's size, find the middle item.

/*
-Ex: If the input is:
Input a number (negative num to stop): 11

Input a number (negative num to stop): 3

Input a number (negative num to stop): 8

Input a number (negative num to stop): 4

Input a number (negative num to stop): 2

Input a number (negative num to stop): 7

Input a number (negative num to stop): -1

-The output is:
Middle item: 4
