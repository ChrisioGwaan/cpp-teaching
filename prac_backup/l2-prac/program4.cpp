*Challenge*

Q4: Given a list of integers, write a function to sort the list (in ascending order), then output the middle integer. 
    A negative number indicates the end of the input (the negative number is not a part of the sorted list). 

Constrains:
1) The maximum number of inputs for any test case should not exceed 9. If exceeded, output "Too many numbers".

Hint: 
1) First read the data into an array. 
2) Then, based on the array's size, find the middle item.
3) If the number of integers is even, return the average of the middle two numbers.
4) Use the knowledge of swapping values and loops, try to write a sorting array function.

/*
-Ex: If the input is:
11 3 8 4 2 7 -1

-The output is:
Middle item: 5
